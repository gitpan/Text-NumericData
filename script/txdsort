=head1 NAME

txdsort - sorting of text data


=head1 SYNOPSIS

	pipe | txdsort [parameters] | pipe

=head1 DESCRIPTION


You can sort for multiple columns, in order and down- or upwards for each column.

=head1 PARAMETERS

These are the general rules for specifying parameters to this program:

	txdsort -s -xyz -s=value --long --long=value [--] [files/stuff]

You mention the parameters/switches you want to change in any order or even multiple times (they are processed in the oder given, later operations overriding/extending earlier settings.
An only mentioned short/long name (no "=value") means setting to 1, which is true in the logical sense. Also, prepending + instead of the usual - negates this, setting the value to 0 (false).
Specifying "-s" and "--long" is the same as "-s=1" and "--long=1", while "+s" and "++long" is the sames as "-s=0" and "--long=0".

There are also different operators than just "=" available, notably ".=", "+=", "-=", "*=" and "/=" for concatenation / appending array/hash elements and scalar arithmetic operations on the value. Arrays are appended to via "array.=element", hash elements are set via "hash.=name=value".


The available parameters are these, default values (in Perl-compatible syntax) at the time of generating this document following the long/short names:

=over 2

=item B<black> (scalar)

	0

ignore whitespace at beginning and end of line (disables strict mode) (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<col>, B<c> (scalar)

	1

the column(s) concerned (first is 1, comma separated list of integers for multi-stage sorting)

=item B<comchar> (scalar)

	undef

comment character (if not set, deduce from data or use #) (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<comregex> (scalar)

	'[#%]*[^\\S\\015\\012]*'

regex for matching comments (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<config>, B<I> (array)

	[]

Which configfile(s) to use (overriding automatic search in likely paths);
special: just -I or --config causes printing a current config file to STDOUT

=item B<down>, B<d> (scalar)

	0

sort descending; normal mode is ascending; may be also comma-separated list of 0 or 1 according to col value

=item B<empty> (scalar)

	0

treat empty lines as empty data sets, preserving them in output (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<fill> (scalar)

	undef

fill value for undefined data (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<help>, B<h> (scalar)

	0

show the help message; 1: normal help, >1: more help; "par": help for paramter "par" only


Additional fun with negative values, optionally followed by comma-separated list of parameter names:
-1: list par names, -2: list one line per name, -3: -2 without builtins, -10: dump values (Perl style), -11: dump values (lines), -100: print POD.

=item B<lineend> (scalar)

	undef

line ending to use: (DOS, MAC, UNIX or be explicit if you can, taken from data if undefined, finally resorting to UNIX) (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<numformat>, B<N> (array)

	[]

printf formats to use (if there is no "%" present at all, one will be prepended) (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<numregex> (scalar)

	'[\\+\\-]?\\d*\\.?\\d*[eE]?\\+?\\-?\\d*'

regex for matching numbers (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<outsep> (scalar)

	undef

use this separator for output (leave undefined to use input separator, fallback to TAB) (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<quote> (scalar)

	undef

quote titles (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<quotechar> (scalar)

	undef

quote character to use (derived from input or ") (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<scan> (scalar)

	0

Introduce empty lines after each block of the last sorting column (when it starts from a smaller value again). That is for creating "scans" for gnuplot pm3d mode.

=item B<separator> (scalar)

	undef

use this separator for input (otherwise deduce from data; TAB is another way to say "tabulator", fallback is	) (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<strict>, B<S> (scalar)

	0

strictly split data lines at configured separator (otherwise more fuzzy logic is involved) (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<text>, B<T> (scalar)

	1

allow text as data (not first column) (from Text::NumericData)

=item B<version> (scalar)

	0

print out the program version

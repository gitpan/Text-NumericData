Revision history for Text-NumericData

2.001000
	- Correct defaults for txdinfo (--strict was on, which differed from the
	  rest). This changes non-buggy behaviour, so bump at least a minor version.

2.000004
	- Fix output format of txdrecycle test to avoide false negatives.
	- Change format of first txdcalc linear interpolation test to avoid
	  sensitivity to rounding mode. Should have chosen less regular input.

2.000003
	- A missing semicolon that broke the code on many installs of Perl
	  (but not mine, for a strange reason) got added.
	- Dependency on Math::Spline got officially added.

2.000002
	- Fix documentation for mentioning the correct list of shortcuts
	  in txdcalc (only x, y and z).

2.000001
	- inevitable documentation fix, finishing off a sentence

2.000000
	- initial release under the new name (replacing TextData-1.x)
